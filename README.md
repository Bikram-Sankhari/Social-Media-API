## Open Issues

### 1. Sending/Accepting/Rejecting friend request should be done over POST requests instead of GET
> As these operatiions make changes in the Database, they should be done over a POST request. But as they require the user to be authenticated, everytime you will need to obtain a CSRF token from another endpoint and include it in the Header of the POST request, which will make the APIs a little bit complex. So to keep the things simple I have implemented them in this way.
